This program uses sorting algorithms to save student grades into files.

#### Function Diagrams

| `input and array management`    |               |  Jullian       |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| `Responsibility Breakdown`         | Handle input of student names and grades, store data in arrays, validate user inputs (e.g., check for valid grade ranges). |
***
| `file i/o handling`   |               |  Kyle      |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| `Responsibility Breakdown`   | Write functions to save and load data to/from files. |
|     |  Ensure file handling robustness (e.g., error handling for invalid file paths).  |
***
| `analysis and search algorithms`         |               |  Cole       |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| `Responsibility Breakdown`    | Develop functions for data analysis, including average calculation and extreme value identification.  |
|       | Implement the binary search algorithm to locate students by name. |

***
| `sorting and integration`         |               |  Kade       |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| `Responsibility Breakdown`    | Implement merge sort for sorting by average grades.  |
|       | Implement quick sort for sorting names alphabetically. |
|       | Integrate all components and ensure smooth data flow. |
|       |  Design the user interface. |
